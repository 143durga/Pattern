Description

This project demonstrates how parametric equations can be used to create visually striking patterns. By plotting points along a parametric curve and applying a color gradient, the result is a vibrant and aesthetic visualization that showcases the power of Python plotting.

Why This Project Matters

Educational: Helps understand parametric equations, plotting, and Python visualization libraries.

Creative: Generates beautiful patterns that can inspire data art and design projects.

Customizable: Easily tweak equations, color maps, and point density to create endless variations.

Features

Dark-themed visualization for a modern, sleek look.

Smooth, high-resolution patterns using 1500 points.

Dynamic color gradients along the curve for visual appeal.

Equal axis scaling ensures correct shape proportions.

Easily customizable to create new patterns or color schemes.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Matplotlib

NumPy

Usage

Clone or download this repository.

Navigate to the project folder:

cd "C:user\Desktop\My Work"


Run the script:

python pattern.py


A window will open displaying the colorful parametric pattern.

Customization

Modify the parametric equations to create new patterns.

Change the colormap in the script to explore different color themes.
